We provide several examples of three-component time-series recording in the Jakarta Basin. This data is as part of the 2018 deployment to study basin structure beneath Greater Jakarta. The study is described in <b>Ry <i>et al.</i> (2019, Geosciences)  </b>and <b>Ry <i>et al.</i> (2023, GJI)</b>

Three-component broadband seismometers (Trillium Compact) and digitizers built by the Australian National University were installed at various sites (Figure below) in two separate deployments. Stations spaced at 3–5 km, were deployed temporarily on a concrete slab floor in schools throughout the city. The 2018 deployment, comprising 143 stations was deployed and aims to include coverage just outside Jakarta in order to reveal the extent of the basin edge. The 30 stations were maintained and redeployed in five phases with at least one-month duration for every site.</p>
